## C# (Roslyn)

> Experimental: Doesn't support opening a solution or project yet.

This is a Zed extension to provide C# through the new Roslyn LSP.

Currently, it relies on a manual installation of the Roslyn Language Server.
Moreover, it doesn't support the basic features of opening a solution or project due to restrictions around Zed's Extension API.
